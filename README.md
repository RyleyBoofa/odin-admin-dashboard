# Odin Admin Dashboard

Mockup admin dashboard, built as my solution to The Odin Project's [Project: Admin Dashboard](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard). This project was built using CSS Grid and Flexbox as a means to practice, and cement, intermediate HTML and CSS concepts by recreating the admin dashboard as seen in the reference image below.

Live preview can be found [here](https://ryleyboofa.github.io/odin-admin-dashboard/).

## New skills used

-   **HTML**: Semantic structuring with `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<section>` elements; integration of an online icon library
-   **CSS**: CSS Grid (including nested grids), responsive layouts with Grid and Flexbox, pseudo-classes and elements, and CSS custom properties
